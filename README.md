# Dotnet Fluent If-Then-Else

## Tasks

The code is set up with tasks you can run from VS Code. The tasks have been made for use with Visual Studio Code just because that's the editor I used to develop. The tasks are simply meant to help simplify the development process; if you're just using the extensions as a user, you won't really care about them.

### How to use them

> `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Ctrl + P ->` followed by pressing `>`)
>
> Then type `Tasks: Run Task`
>
> The tasks should appear in a dropdown box and it's pretty straightforward from there!

### Summary of the tasks available

| Task  | Description                                                  |
